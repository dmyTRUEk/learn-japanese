## Todo:
- add kanji to end of days, to understand that that is a day
- impl smarter `kana_to_latin`, so that `riyu` -> `ryu`, `*ha` -> `*wa`, etc
- refactor `str_or_list_to_str` -> `custom_repr` or smt like that
- print description
- rewrite all using pipes
- extract strings from main into constants
- add more Kanji
